# fcc-marcus-aurelius-tribute-page

This is number 1 of 5 projects of Responsive Web Design course by freecodecamp.org.

I decided to make a tribute page about Marcus Aurelius because I like Stoicism, and he's one of many stoic philosophers to introduce me into it. The code itself took a while, because procrastination lmao. I don't know if my codes are clean or not, but if it works, it works.
